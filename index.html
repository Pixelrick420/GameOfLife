            <span class='right'>- John Conway</span></p>
            <p>The game of life is not a conventional game with players and win conditions, but a 
            simulation consisting of a grid of cells with simple rules goverining the evolution 
            of patterns formed by these cells.</p>
            <p>In the game, a cell can either be alive or dead. The state of being alive is denoted 
            by 1 (green) and the dead cells are zeros (red).</p>
            <p>Each state of the board is like a moment in time. The state of the board in the next 
            moment depends on 4 rules.<br />
            Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.<br />
            Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br />
            Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.<br />
            Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>"Why?" <br />
            <span class='right'>-You(probably)</span></p>
            <p>Because we are going to mars.(real)</p>
            <p>This game is an example of cellular automation. Given any possible cell state, it is
            impossible to predict what the board will look like after say, 50 steps without actually
            running the simulation. Put more rigourously, given 2 board states A and B, there 
            exisits no algorithm that can predict whether state B will appear at any point when
            state A is simulated.</p>
            <p>The game of life is Turing complete. This means that the game can perform any computation that a Turing machine can. So.. yes, given enough cells, you can build a computer inside the game. Feel free to try it yourself.
            (Actually try, make some cool patterns, see if you can find board states that do not 
            change over time, there are 5 in total)(click on controls)</p>

            <p>How to go to mars(Tutorial)</p>
            <p>Note: This is not a tutorial, any limbs lost while attempting to following it will not be covered by the author.</p>
            <p>(Assuming you have created the universe already) <br />
            Step 1 : Send robots supplied with sufficient amounts of hydrogen, a chemical plant 
            and a small nuclear reactor. <br />
            Step 2: Once there, the robots should start self replicating and carrying out chemical 
            processes that release oxygen and methane into the atmosphere. <br />
            Step 2.5: Assuming humans have found a way to generate magnetic fields strong
            enough to sustain mars, get the robots to do that as well.<br />
            Step 3: Wait.<br />
            Step 4: Do step 3 again.<br />
            Step 5: Once the atmosphere and magnetic field are ready, you can send humans to
            mars.<br />
            Step 6: idk man, I can't read more wikipedia articles on mars colonisation ok, like, what tf is a Trans-Mars injection. Leave the rest of the steps to Elon Musk prob, I assume he has morphed into a soulless robotic husk of his former self by this point.</p>

            <br />
            Going back to the game of life, how do you actually make self replicating systems?
            Consider machine A that can build copies of machine B. A must be more complex than
            B, right? John von Neumann, in his 2D system for cellular automata, found a particular pattern would self replicate. This design is called the tessellation model. It consisted of a configuration of 200,000 cells and 29 board states. So, in this case machines A and B are the same.</p>
            <p>But this was complex and messy. Conway wanted to find a much simpler system that could exhibit the same self replicating behaviour. Well, he did it.</p>
            <p>The game of life achieves universal cellular automatation to the point where the game itself can be built within the game.
            </p>
            <p>John Conway's Game of Life is not a conventional game with players and win conditions. It has however, like any popular game, captured the intrest of millions of people around the world.</p>

            <hr>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>I recommend trying to find oscillators(patterns that repeat after a certain number
            of board states) or spaceships(patterns that move through the grid while oscillating)
            before heading further. Consider this a spoiler warning if you will.</p>
